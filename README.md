Here it is.  The file that I am pushing up from the CLI.
I have to use git remote add origin then paste the SSH address to the repo into the cli
Then I'd need to do git push -u and then hit enter

That's fairly complex, but I think I've got it.  Also I've saved this as a form of note-taking, so there's that.


Some text here.
