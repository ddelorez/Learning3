Here it is.  The file that I am pushing up from the CLI.
I have to use git remote add origin then paste the SSH address to the repo into the cli
Then I'd need to do git push -u and then hit enter

That's fairly complex, but I think I've got it.  Also I've saved this as a form of note-taking, so there's that.

Some text here.

This sort of builds a new branch where I can work on a feature and not break
the main code, but still track all of the changes.  It works with the
original files, but lets you add stuff with no impact, and if it's all good,
they can merge back in later.  I haven't gotten to that part yet, but it's
coming up.
